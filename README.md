# RNA-seq Data Analysis (R Shiny Application)

This R Shiny application features multiple bioinformatics processes implemented in R:
- Visualize and explore summary of sample metadata using tables and plots.
- Normalize, explore and visualize counts matrix and allow the user to choose different gene filtering thresholds based on their statistical properties and assess their effects using diagnostic plots of the counts matrix.
- Performe differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and explore the resulting dataset using PCA, and filtering based on p adjusted thresholds.
- Visualize Individual Gene Expression(s) counts from an arbitrary gene broken out by a desired sample information variable.
